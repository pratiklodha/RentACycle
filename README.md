# RentACycle
Research project

Commuting and mobility has become a major issue due to increase in population and urbanization. 
Hence there has been a significant rise in number of people who are adopting ‘Cycle for Work’ initiative. 
Encouraging this trend, We RentACycle have designed a plan which will make it easy for people to rent a cycle 
through mobile application by scanning bar code present on cycle and commute.
